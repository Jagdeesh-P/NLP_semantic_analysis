## Features  

1. **Semantic Search**  
   - Combines **BM25** keyword matching and **SBERT embeddings** for semantic similarity ranking.  
   - Prioritized search results based on likes and views.  

2. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Utilizes **HuggingFaceâ€™s sentiment analysis pipeline** to analyze video comments.  
   - Calculates the percentage of positive sentiments for ranking recommendations.  

3. **Video Management**  
   - Stores video metadata (title, description, likes, views, comments, and thumbnails) in MongoDB.  
   - Semantic search queries and matches are stored for faster retrieval.  

4. **User Interaction**  
   - Users can like videos and add comments (up to 200 characters).  
   - Real-time updates to MongoDB for likes and comments.  

5. **Administrative Automation**  
   - Batch processes pre-populated food-related search queries.  
   - Updates sentiment scores automatically.
